## What is UK Health Camp?
There’s lots of brilliant things happening to make health and care services better for patients, carers and professionals.

**Our aim is to provide a space to connect, share ideas and make things happen.**

This isn't the first HealthCamp - [similar events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthCamp) have been held in other countries and in the UK two years ago.

**We are open to all**, whether you work for the NHS or not.

Our events are multidisciplinary - we aim to bring together health and care professionals, policy makers and service managers together with designers, digital specialists and technologists. Everyone is welcome.

**We have a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).**

## How does it work?
UK Health Camp isn’t a healthcare IT conference. It is:

- Free to attend
- Free from keynotes and sponsor pitches
- Designed by its participants: everyone attending can pitch a topic or actively take part in sessions
- Based on the [Open Space principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) like our sister [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org)-style events [UKGovcamp](http://www.ukgovcamp.com) and [LocalGovCamp](http://localgovdigital.info/localgovcamp/)
